Hi, my name is Edward Raphael L. Viñegas.

I studied Senior High School at Congressional Integrated High School and currently taking
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at De La Salle University - Dasmariñas. 
I recently completed my internship last August and created something related to computer vision and AI.

Outside academics, I spend my time refreshing and improving my programming skills and playing video games. 
I rarely watch movies and series, so I can't say much about it. But when I do, I like watching comedy or drama.
In terms of music, I mostly listen to pop music, covering 35% of my Spotify playlists. Some of my favorite 
artists include Ed Sheeran and TWICE, both having an appearance in 207 tracks among my playlists.
